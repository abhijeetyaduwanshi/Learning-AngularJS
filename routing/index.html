<!--
	in the section opening tag use ng-include="'login.html'"
	so now the ng-include has pulled the login page and set it to the section
	but we need the li buttons to be clicked and then pull the template so put the ng-click and assign a local property say tmpl in mctrl and assign the templates to it
	and remove the hardcoded ng-include from the section and put the local tmpl property on mctrl
	since we didnot click on anything we dont see this on the UI
	once we click on the li the click gets initiated and the local tmpl property gets invoked and the UI gets updated now all our li work
	but if we refresh the page its going to go to the first page and not refresh the current page this is because of the url is the same and only the UI is changing but not the url
	even the back and the forward buttons on the browswrs will not work if the url is not changed
-->
<!--
	this is why we use routing which helps us to divide into logical views and bind different controllers
	its a combination of a route view and a controller
	to configure the routing in the app, ngRoute module, external module that you have to download like messages which is angular-route.min.js and pull it in the script below the angular import
	then go to your script.js to inject it into the myApp module
